# NegetivPressureBooth
## Inspiration💭
The true heroes of our nation are the doctors and the paramedical officers who help the one who is affected and save our lives by putting their own in harm's way, but day by day the number of cases are increasing and these also include the doctors. Proposed  model through which we can implement contactless diagnosis.

## What it does❓
•It is a multiple sample collecting booth where Negative pressure is maintained to prevent leakage of any contaminants outside.
•The health workers interact with the patient through an isolation glove box to avoid direct contact.
•The booth has additional facilities of Phone , Stethoscope, Temperature detection ,Contaminated detection for security purposes.

## How we built it👨‍💻
•Ventilated air is filtered through HEPA units and discarded in environment in 2.5min which is filled in the center at the top of the cabin.
•The size of the inlet vent and circular exhaust are selected such that the flow area at the inlet and exhaust are similar.

## Challenges we ran into🚀
Major Challenges were to define Booth parameters,converting into Portable Booth, Preventing Leakage and Budget 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of🏆
To simulate NPB
Since we had prior experience with hardware. It was nice to see work together even when doing everything virtually. In the beginning, we underestimated the difficulty of making and defining Structure, but we ran into many challenges along the way, so it was awesome to see how it all played out in the end.

## What we learned👨‍🏫
Through this project, we learned a lot about different kinds of filters and simulation . We also learned about teamwork since we had to do everything virtually. We learned to efficiently divide tasks so everyone had something to do and we finished the project in time.

## What's next for Beyblade AR🔮
 To implement other features such as cost,solar panel integration
